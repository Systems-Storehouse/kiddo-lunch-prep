   - We add all kinds of leftovers to these (any veggies, bacon, shredded other meat) 

### Buy pre-made
Prep of pre-made items is usually much lower effort.  There are SO many option here, but these are the ones we link that don't compromise too much on mutrition.
- Empanadas
  - Some mixture of [these different flavors](https://brazibites.com/category/empanadas/)
  - We pack these with Ketchup 
- Frozen Mini Corn Dogs
  - I mentioned making these above, but they are also for sale premade.  Selfishly, I like making them because I have to eat GF and like cornbread.  Also, we will make Cherry Corn Muffins at the same time, so it still feels worth it to us.
- Falafel + Hummus
  - We get these frozen from Trader Joe's because their variety is GF.  But you can also pick up a pile from your nearest resturant with some Hummus and freeze what you won't use soon (and support local eateries).
  - We eat so much Hummus at our house that we make it by the quart every other weekend.  My partner doesn't even follow a recipe anymore, but I know it involves roasting a few cups of garlic cloves.  If that's your jam, reach out and we can write out our process.

### Make ahead week of
We prep each item as needed on the weekend so that all food is ready for the week OR we will plan to have a dinner earlier in the week with this food and cook extra.  

- Mini Pizzas
  - Usually something like [this bread](https://arnoldbread.com/sandwich-thins-rolls) with some pizza sauce, corn (frozen bag of corn is a staple for us), olives, and cheese.
- Ravioli 
  - We option for spinach and ricotta, to up the nutritional value
- Ham, Cheese, Honey Mustard Sandwich
  - We are still "training" on sandwiches, which are not normal in our house other than PB&J.  This combo has given us the biggest success.  We use the same bread as pizzas above.
- Simple pasta with olive oil
  - We find a really simple meal helps put the focus eating the veggies.  We often have some cooked pasta in our fridge to use for dinners, but knowing earlier in the week that we need some for a lunch helps set some constraints on our dinner plans.
