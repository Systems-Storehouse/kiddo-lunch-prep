## Veggies
*Half of every main lunch entree is vegetables.  Mostly, we stick with roasting 2 half pans with cauliflour, broccoli, and sweet potatoes.*

### Our really easy veggie roasting system
 
- Preheat oven to 450
- Wash & cut up all veggies and place on sheet pans, with sweet potatoes on a separate pan.
- Drizzle a some but not a ton of olive oil
- Pick yours spices and add to the veggies
  - Current favorite is [this mix](https://www.penzeys.com/online-catalog/chip-dip-seasoning/c-24/p-564/pd-s)
- Check on veggies.  Broccoli & cauliflour will need to come out before the sweet potatoes.
