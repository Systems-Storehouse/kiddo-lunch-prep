## Guiding Principles for Lunch Prep

*Yes, it's silly to have guiding principles about preschool lunch prep.  But it helps me think about why we follow and iterate on this system.  It also helps describe to others what our values are.  No worries if you don't have the same priorities.*

#### Our child gets to exhibit choice and opinion around what they eat
   - Not only do we think that choice helps motivate our kid to actually eat what is packed, but we see this as an opportunity to teach planning strategies.  I'm a project/program manager, so I have to start them young.
   - It's nice to offload some of the decision making, now that we have created a boundary.
#### Our child has to help in the making of some of their lunch foods
   - Partially, we know that if the kid is involved in the process, he is more likely to eat the food that is packed.
   - Additionally, we think it's important to deliberatly teach our kid how to cook.  We are in the kitchen a ton, making food both strictly from recipes and sort of "pull things out of the fridge and figure out some combination that will not be too gross."  Our kitchen helper is probably the most valued piece of kid gear we have recieved because he has been part of the action since 11 months.
#### The food we offer for lunches is both varied and nutritious
   - We want to encourage trying new foods and being flexible about what is available to eat.
   - Cooking our own stuff often gives us plenty of opportunity to throw in nutrient-dense ingredients and adapting foods with ingredients we know our kid is into at the moment.
#### We are two fulltime working parents, and we want to build a system that is sustainable while providing for as much of the above as possible.
   - We try to convert the time cost of doing our prep this way by making it an activity with our kiddo and batching the work to make it efficent.

#### *Some other considerations*
   - I'm always looking for ways to cut fincancial costs within our family, but with this system, I know I need to balance this desire with everything else we want and value.
   - I have to eat Gluten Free, so much but not all of these foods are as well.  Who wants to bake food they can't try?!
