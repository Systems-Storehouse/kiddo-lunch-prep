*I have a compulsion for making efficent systems for anything I need to do at some regular cadence.  My system for kiddo lunch prep has come up in a few conversations lately and I promised I'd write it out.  Well here you go, my lunch prep routine, complete with links to specific recipes and my overall guiding principles.  Yup, the documentation is overkill, but it was really interesting to highlight a labor of love that so many parents take on but are not recognized for.  It's both a display of my systems passion and a means to an end to keep the family lights on efficently without compromising on what is important to us.  Hope it's helpful to someone.  Happy to hear any feedback.  -Lizzy*

## On Saturdays, we meal prep
Well, actually, on Saturdays, we do several routines that help set us up for success for the next work/school week.  One of those routines is meal planning with a preschooler. :scream:  It's been really sucessful now that we have iterated a bit on where we set boundaries and where we allow for choice.

## Our General Packed Lunch Formula
Every weekend, we create a plan for the following three meals/snacks every day.  The formula creates enough predictability and cuts down on decision fatigue.  The rotations help add enough variety so that we don't get into a rut and burn out on the favorites.

| Meal Name    | Guidelines     | Container  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Morning Snack | Nuts & Fruit Rotation | [![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OnIkjQv3L._AC_SL1500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Sistema-Attack-13-86oz-compartments-Container/dp/B01JWNF988/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Sistema+Snack+Attack&qid=1630009760&sr=8-1) |
| Lunch | 1/2 Main Entree, 1/2 Veggie Rotation  | [![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T0mcLNIzL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NSJ88V8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) |
| Afternoon Snack | Something we have baked or a hearty premade snack | [![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JSiBev3pL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SJA8QNQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) |

## The routine in a nutshell:

 - Determine what options are available for this week.
   - Make note of all frozen options.
   - Assess what needs to be baked to replenish frozen supply.
   - Make a call about what non frozen options you are willing to make that week.
 - Present the options to the preschooler and write out the full week of choices.
   - We write out choices for three packed lunch pieces for the whole week.  All items are rotated and we don't do the same combo twice.
   - [Here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46985575/131226213-7741d2f3-fc3a-4332-afee-320612ae09da.jpeg) is what our menu looks like.  We like having it written out and talking about the food as we pack it each morning to hype it up.
 - Bake and Roast
   - You already chose what to bake.  When it's cooled, freeze what is not being used for the week.
   - Roast a week's worth of veggies.
   - Remember, this is supposed to be a fun activity that involves the kid.  It isn't always fun, but it's important to try and keep an open mind and balance getting the task done with making it fun.
 - Between the frozen supply and newly baked food, you should have most of the food you need to create all the lunches you need for the week.
   - There is some food you might want to make later in the week (see this section) but this should be a small portion of the overall set of food.
